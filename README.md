3 Nov (1hr) - read about Parallax PIR motion sensor online.

1 Nov (3hrs) - met with partner at MV library to complete homework 4 and discuss term project. Bought a liquid crystal display and a motion sensor.  Partner will try out LCD and I will try out motion sensor.  Aim is to integrate these components with mbeds and initially perhaps display sensor readings on the LCD, in a later phase, push sensor readings to a cloud server, which could display the readings in a web browser.

31 Oct (3hrs) - wired up breadboard as required for homework 4 (program example 7.9); entered program 7.9 in mbed environment (https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/#nav:/pgm_example_7_9/main.cpp), compiled and downloaded it to target board; reread Chapter 7 in Fast and Effective Embedded Systems Design.

30 Oct (1hr) - read Chapter 7 in preparation for homework 4; will meet with lab partner on Saturday to complete homework and discuss term project
