Program assignment 3 instructions:
Read Chapters 1-3 and 14
Program Example 14.1 Manipulating control registers to flash an LED
Program Example 14.3 Combined digital input and output
Compile and download Program Examples 14.1 and 14.3 to your mbed board.

First versions of the example programs were done with the mbed library because I did not yet have red and green leds to connect to the breadboard, so the on-board LEDs served to show activity.
